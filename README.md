## 🙋‍♂️ About me

- I like building things that are practical, reliable, and not too mysterious to understand later.
- Most of my projects live somewhere between scripts, small services, and tools that remove repetitive work.
- I have been getting more into software architecture and how code maps to real world domains.
- I am also interested in DevOps and the space where development, deployment, and operations meet.

## 🎯 Favorite languages and tools

- 🔵 **Go** and 🦀 **Rust** for backend services and tools where performance and simplicity matter  
- ☕ **Java** for more traditional backend work and structured projects  
- 🌱 **Vue.js** for frontend when I need to build a UI  
- 🐚 **Bash** and 🐍 **Python** for scripting, automation, and glue code  

These are the stacks you are most likely to see across my repositories.

## 🧪 What you will find here

- Small and medium projects where I try out ideas in design and structure  
- Experiments that might get refactored a few times as I learn more  
- Utility code and tools that came out of solving my own problems  

This is not a perfectly curated portfolio. It is more like a working bench.

## 📚 Things I am studying

- "Domain Driven Design" by Eric Evans  
- Concepts around modular design, bounded contexts, and clearer boundaries in code  
- Better habits for testing and keeping projects healthy as they grow  

This section will probably change as I move through books and ideas.
