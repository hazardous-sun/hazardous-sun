## About me

- I like building things that are practical, reliable, and not too mysterious to understand later
- Most of my projects live somewhere between scripts, small services, and tools that remove repetitive work
- I have been getting into software architecture and how code maps to real world domains

---

## Favorite languages and tools

- **Go**, **Java**, and **Rust** for backend services and tools
- **Vue.js** for frontend
- **Bash** and **Python** for scripting, automation, and glue code
